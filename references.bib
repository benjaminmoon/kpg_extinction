  abstract = {The South China Block has experienced multiple phases of tectonic deformation since the Middle Jurassic. Understanding this deformation history helps reveal the driving mechanisms responsible and sheds light on the associated magmatism and mineralization. Here, we construct deformable plate tectonic reconstructions for the South China Block from 170~Ma to the present using GPlates. The deformation starts with a NW–SE-oriented shortening phase from 170 to 136~Ma. Subsequently, South China experienced two episodes of extension in the Cretaceous, during 136–118~Ma and 100–80~Ma, respectively. The Cenozoic extension occurred mostly along the southeast continental margin, including the East China Sea Shelf Basin, and rift basins in the northern South China Sea margin and the Taiwan margin segment. The rifting was initiated nearly simultaneously along the continental margin at \textasciitilde 65~Ma and ceased at \textasciitilde 34–30~Ma. The northern portion of the Okinawa Trough started rifting at 15~Ma, while the southern portion rifted in the last few million years. The Luzon Volcanic Arc’ thrusting onto the southeasternmost South China Block since 6.5~Ma caused the still-active Taiwan Orogeny. The predicted accumulated deformation at present-day is characterized by overall shortening onshore with contraction factors mostly between 0.8 and 1 and extension offshore with stretching factors generally between 1 and 2. The Central China Orogen and Taiwan Orogen experienced more intense shortening relative to the interior South China by factors down to 0.6. The Okinawa Trough experienced intense stretching by factors up to 2.5 in its central part. The intraplate deformation in the South China Block is closely related to the subduction of the Izanagi and Pacific plates. The Jurassic and earliest Cretaceous shortening was likely induced by trench advance, and the extension during the Cretaceous and the Cenozoic was mostly driven by subduction retreat.},

  abstract = {Global deep-time plate motion models have traditionally followed a classical rigid plate approach, even though plate deformation is known to be significant. Here we present a global Mesozoic–Cenozoic deforming plate motion model that captures the progressive extension of all continental margins since the initiation of rifting within Pangea at 240 Ma. The model also includes major failed continental rifts and compressional deformation along collision zones. The outlines and timing of regional deformation episodes are reconstructed from a wealth of published regional tectonic models and associated geological and geophysical data. We reconstruct absolute plate motions in a mantle reference frame with a joint global inversion using hot spot tracks for the last 80 million years and minimizing global trench migration velocities and net lithospheric rotation. In our optimized model, net rotation is consistently below 0.2°/Myr, and trench migration scatter is substantially reduced. Distributed plate deformation reaches a Mesozoic peak of 30 × 106 km2 in the Late Jurassic ( 160–155 Ma), driven by a vast network of rift systems. After a mid-Cretaceous drop in deformation, it reaches a high of 48 x 106 km2 in the Late Eocene ( 35 Ma), driven by the progressive growth of plate collisions and the formation of new rift systems. About a third of the continental crustal area has been deformed since 240 Ma, partitioned roughly into 65\% extension and 35\% compression. This community plate model provides a framework for building detailed regional deforming plate networks and form a constraint for models of basin evolution and the plate-mantle system.},

  abstract = {We have devised a new absolute Late Jurassic-Cretaceous Pacific plate model using a fixed hot spot approach coupled with paleomagnetic data from Pacific large igneous provinces (LIPs) while simultaneously minimizing plate velocity and net lithosphere rotation (NR). This study was motivated because published Pacific plate models for the 83.5- to 150-Ma time interval are variably flawed, and their use affects modeling of the entire Pacific-Panthalassic Ocean and interpretation of its margin evolution. These flaws could be corrected, but the revised models would imply unrealistically high plate velocities and NR. We have developed three new Pacific realm models with varying degrees of complexity, but we focus on the one that we consider most realistic. This model reproduces many of the Pacific volcanic paths, modeled paleomagnetic latitudes fit well with direct observations, plate velocities and NR resulting from the model are low, and all reconstructed Pacific LIPs align along the surface-projected margin of the Pacific large low shear wave velocity province. The emplacement of the Shatsky Rise LIP at 144 Ma probably caused a major plate boundary reorganization as indicated by a major jump of the Pacific-Izanagi-Farallon triple junction and a noteworthy change of the Pacific-Izanagi seafloor spreading direction at around chron M20 time.},

  abstract = {Detailed global plate motion models that provide a continuous description of plate boundaries through time are an effective tool for exploring processes both at and below the Earth's surface. A new generation of numerical models of mantle dynamics pre- and post-Pangea timeframes requires global kinematic descriptions with full plate reconstructions extending into the Paleozoic (410 Ma). Current plate models that cover Paleozoic times are characterised by large plate speeds and trench migration rates because they assume that lowermost mantle structures are rigid and fixed through time. When used as a surface boundary constraint in geodynamic models, these plate reconstructions do not accurately reproduce the present-day structure of the lowermost mantle. Building upon previous work, we present a global plate motion model with continuously closing plate boundaries ranging from the early Devonian at 410 Ma to present day. We analyse the model in terms of surface kinematics and predicted lower mantle structure. The magnitude of global plate speeds has been greatly reduced in our reconstruction by modifying the evolution of the synthetic Panthalassa oceanic plates, implementing a Paleozoic reference frame independent of any geodynamic assumptions, and implementing revised models for the Paleozoic evolution of North and South China and the closure of the Rheic Ocean. Paleozoic (410–250 Ma) RMS plate speeds are on average ∼8~cm/yr, which is comparable to Mesozoic–Cenozoic rates of ∼6~cm/yr on average. Paleozoic global median values of trench migration trend from higher speeds (∼2.5~cm/yr) in the late Devonian to rates closer to 0~cm/yr at the end of the Permian (∼250 Ma), and during the Mesozoic–Cenozoic (250–0 Ma) generally cluster tightly around ∼1.1~cm/yr. Plate motions are best constrained over the past 130 Myr and calculations of global trench convergence rates over this period indicate median rates range between 3.2~cm/yr and 12.4~cm/yr with a present day median rate estimated at ∼5~cm/yr. For Paleozoic times (410–251 Ma) our model results in median convergence rates largely ∼5~cm/yr. Globally, ∼90\% of subduction zones modelled in our reconstruction are determined to be in a convergent regime for the period of 120–0 Ma. Over the full span of the model, from 410 Ma to 0 Ma, ∼93\% of subduction zones are calculated to be convergent, and at least 85\% of subduction zones are converging for 97\% of modelled times. Our changes improve global plate and trench kinematics since the late Paleozoic and our reconstructions of the lowermost mantle structure challenge the proposed fixity of lower mantle structures, suggesting that the eastern margin of the African LLSVP margin has moved by as much as ∼1450~km since late Permian times (260 Ma). The model of the plate-mantle system we present suggests that during the Permian Period, South China was proximal to the eastern margin of the African LLSVP and not the western margin of the Pacific LLSVP as previous thought.},
